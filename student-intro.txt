What did you do before this bootcamp?

I was a research assistant for the last year working with the Air Force Institute of Technology.
Before that I worked as a production employee with a saw blade manufacturing company. I also served four
 years in the United States Air Force.

Why are you taking this bootcamp?

I want to learn a new skill that will help to propell my career forward. I have had a few projects here
and there that I have coded for and I enjoyed them immensely.

I would absolutly love to work for GE. I have worked with their additive manufactuing team to help the 
Air Force Institute of Technology to better understand the capabilities of their 3-D printers.
